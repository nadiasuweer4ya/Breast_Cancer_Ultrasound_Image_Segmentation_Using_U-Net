# Inspiration
One individual who greatly inspires me in my pursuit of becoming a software engineer is Craig Federighi from Apple. His exceptional skills and contributions to the field of software engineering have left a lasting impression on me. I aspire to follow in his footsteps and make a positive impact on the world through my work as a software engineer.
